# Question

Is ReactRouter a package for **client-side routing** or **server-side routing**?

# Answer

React is a package for **client-side routing**.

It allows us to handle navigation within a React application without needing to refresh the entire page, making the user experience smoother and faster.

On the other hand, server-side routing, involves handling routes on the server and sending the appropriate HTML content to the client based on the request.
