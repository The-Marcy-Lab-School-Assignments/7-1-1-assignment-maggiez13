# Question

What are the benefits of single-page apps (SPAs) versus multi-page apps (MPAs)?

# Answer

Single-page apps (SPAs) provide quicker load times, a more seamless user experience, lower server demands, and greater UI control, making them well-suited for dynamic applications.

After the initial load, SPAs can retrieve data asynchronously and update the UI without needing to reload the entire page, resulting in faster interactions. With most processing done on the client side, the server primarily delivers data through APIs, reducing server load and improving scalability.

On the other hand, multi-page apps (MPAs) are better for SEO, easier analytics, scalability, and security, making them suitable for large, content-heavy websites.
