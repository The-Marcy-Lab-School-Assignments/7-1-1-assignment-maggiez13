# Question

When is it appropriate to use the `"*"` path for a `Route` in React Router?

# Answer

The `"*"` path is used as a catch-all route. It typically handles cases where no other routes match and is often displayed as a "Not Found" page for any undefined/non-existent routes.

The `"*"` path ensures that users are redirected to a specific page when they navigate to an incorrect/unknown URL.
