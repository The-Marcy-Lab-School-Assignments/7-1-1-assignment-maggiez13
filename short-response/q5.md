# Question

With React Router, which of the following path(s) will match the `/products/:id` path?

1. `/products`
2. `/products/apple`
3. `/products/5`
4. `/products/5/about`

Explain your answer.

# Answer

Paths 2 and 3 will match the `/products/:id` path:

2. `/products/apple`
3. `/products/5`

Both paths follow the pattern `/products/:id`, where `:id` is dynamic and can match any value, such as `apple` or `5`.

Path 1 and 4 does not match the `/products/:id` path:

1. `/products` does not have the `:id` value after `/products`.

2. `/products/5/about` has an additional segment `/about` that goes beyond the `/products/:id` pattern.
